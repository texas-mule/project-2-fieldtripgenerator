The Wilds of Africa attraction includes the chimpanzee forest, the gorilla center and an aviary on a quarter-mile nature trail where you will explore several habitats including forest, mountain, woodland, river, desert and brush. Be sure to take the 20-minute monorail ride, which runs the course of the attraction and costs an additional fee but is well worth it.
